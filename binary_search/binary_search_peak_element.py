A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside
the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
    nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
