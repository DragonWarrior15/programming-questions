"""
Big P has become a Physical Education teacher at Hack International School.

Today, the students of class XII have been very undisciplined and he decides to punish them all.

He makes all of the N student (numbered 1 to N ) to stand in a line and asks them to sit down on their knees.

Students know that Big P is a very cruel and sadistic person and students start to sit down themselves when they see a friend sit down.

However, there are always some students who do not follow the trend. Now when Big P sees that happen ,
he slaps that student and makes him sit down. The same process as above is followed and is stopped 
when any - one student in the line refuses to sit down by himself.

Given the students that Big P slaps to make them sit down , you need to tell the total no. of students who sat down in that line.

Note: It is not necessary that if A is friend of B then B is also friend of A.

Input Format :
First Line Contains an integer T denoting no of test cases. 
Each test case begins with a line containing three integers  where N is the number of students in the line. 
Next F lines have two integers A and B denoting the friendship between the students A and B. 
Next S lines have one integer X denoting the student that was slapped by Big P .

Output Format:
For each test case, output a line containing one integer, the total number of students that sit down in that line.
