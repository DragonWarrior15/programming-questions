/*
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest 
increasing subsequence.

Example:
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], 
therefore the length is 4. 

Note:
    There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary 
    for you to return the length. Your algorithm should 
    run in O(n2) complexity.
    Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
