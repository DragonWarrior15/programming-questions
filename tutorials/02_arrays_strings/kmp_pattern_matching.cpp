/*
Given 2 strings, P and T, find the number of occurrences of P in T.

Input:
First line contains string P, and second line contains the string T.

Output:
Print a single integer, the number of occurrences of P in T.

Constraints:
1 <= |P| <= |T| <= 10^5

/*
kmp algorithm
the kmp algorithm works by using patterns in the pattern itself
first we need to know an lps array
create an lps (longest proper prefix also a suffix)
lps[i] will indicate the length of longest prefix in P[0..i] 
that is also a suffix in P[0..i]
example, lps of aabaa is 01012
consider a matching example
aabacaa
aabaa
we start with i=0 and j=0, keep incrementing them while there is a match
we reach i=4 and j=4 at first mismatch, now notice that lps[j-1] tells us
the longest suffix that matches prefix, and since pattern matches text for
first j-1 chars, we can simply slide the pattern lps[j-1] characters, see below
where the longest prefix and suffix are marked in <> brackets
<a>ab<a>caa
<a>ab<a>a
now we simply slide the pattern such that the angular brackets align again
<a>ab<a>caa
     <a>ab<a>a
and since we know the prefix and suffix match, we can start the comparison from
the next character after the prefix
aabacaa
   aabaa
start comparing a and c next and the cycle repeats

creating ths lps array
we greedily try to match the maximum length possible at any index
see the code for complete implementation
